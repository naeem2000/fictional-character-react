    <p>Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan. He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with the intention of beginning an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito Uchiha shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his final death</p>

    <p>Madara was born during the Warring States Period, and was the eldest of Tajima Uchiha's five children. Madara and his siblings grew up on the battlefield waging constant war with the Uchiha's rivals: the Senju. Three of his siblings died young, leaving Madara with only his younger brother, Izuna. Madara and Izuna became very close through their shared loss and constantly competed with each other to get stronger. This, combined with his naturally strong chakra, enabled the young Madara to defeat adult Senju in battle and develop a reputation as a genius.</p>

    <h1>Personality</h1>
<div style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255) ; padding-bottom: 380px; border: 1px solid rgb(251, 252, 251); height:150px; border-radius:40px">
    <p>Madara's childhood was a product of the times he lived in: the constant fighting made him a perfectionist that would keep at
    something until he mastered it, and his triumphs on the battlefield made him very confident in his abilities and talent. Whenever
    one of these personality traits was challenged, as they tended to be by Hashirama, Madara's competitive streak would emerge.
    Madara did not mind Hashirama's influence in this regard; he believed that the only way to survive in the shinobi world was to make
    allies with one's enemies. His exposure to Hashirama is credited for Madara not experiencing the Uchiha's "Curse of Hatred"
    or at the very least, not being victimised by it as much as Izuna was and even though he claimed to have abandoned his friendship
    with Hashirama, Madara still held onto their friendship subconsciously. Madara's actions and beliefs were singularly focused on
    protecting Izuna, his only surviving brother. So long as he had Izuna, Madara was reasonable and kind, willing to make concessions
    for a perceived greater good.</p>

    <p>One of the exceptions Madara makes was Hashirama. Their years of rivalry left Madara with competing feelings of respect and resentment for Hashirama. Madara considered Hashirama the only opponent worthy of his time and would postpone his own plans if it meant prolonging his time to fight with Hashirama without issue. Despite this, Madara is quite open-minded about recognising other strong individuals besides Hashirama, as when he declares Might Guy as the strongest taijutsu user he's ever faced. Despite his prowess and intellect, Madara is not without moments of recklessness. When he was brought back to life, he showed no hesitation in absorbing Hashirama's senjutsu chakra while admitting he expected to have some difficulty controlling it due to having no prior training.</p>

    <p>Madara was one of the most powerful shinobi in history, recognised as the strongest Uchiha in his lifetime and for decades after his
        death. A child prodigy, he killed several adult Senju before he had awakened his Sharingan. History remembers him as the only one
        able to compete with Hashirama Senju, a "God of Shinobi", and pushed him to his absolute limits. When Obito operated under Madara's
        name, fear of Madara's power forced the Five Great Shinobi Countries, and the neutral Land of Iron, to band together and trigger the
        Fourth Shinobi World War, as it was noted Madara's name itself was power. After his return from death and various enhancements,
        Madara was able to decisively defeat thousands of shinobi, the Five Kage, and the nine tailed beasts, all at one respectively.</p>

      <p>Madara and his brother Izuna were the first Uchiha known to have awakened the Mangekyō Sharingan. Madara knew about other users' Mangekyō techniques, and was also capable of discerning the mechanics of these techniques with brief observation. After stealing Kakashi Hatake's Mangekyō Sharingan, he was able to use Kamui on himself immediately. With his eyesight deteriorating from overuse, he replaced his original eyes with Izuna's, restoring his vision and gaining the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan. The "straight tomoe" (直巴, Choku Tomoe) of his Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan granted him fluidity in his movements when fighting</p>

      <p>Years after infusing himself with Hashirama's DNA and unknowingly mixing Indra's and Asura's chakra, Madara's Sharingan evolved
          into the Rinnegan. As the eyes' original owner, only he could use them to their maximum power. He was able to switch between both
          dōjutsu. With the Rinnegan, Madara could use all of the abilities of the Six Paths Technique, such as the Preta Path to absorb chakra
          and the Deva Path to perform Chibaku Tensei. He could also use the Outer Path to create chakra chains that could restrain all nine
          tailed beasts. and black receivers for various melee and supplementary purposes. Through the usage of his Rinnegan with that of his
          Sharingan, Madara could summon meteorites to cause widespread destruction.</p>
