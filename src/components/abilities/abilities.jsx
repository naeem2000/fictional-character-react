              Madara was one of the most powerful shinobi in history, recognised as the strongest Uchiha in his lifetime and for decades after his death. A child prodigy, he killed several adult Senju before he had awakened his Sharingan. History remembers him as the only one able to compete with Hashirama Senju, a "God of Shinobi", and pushed him to his absolute limits. When Obito operated under Madara's name, fear of Madara's power forced the Five Great Shinobi Countries, and the neutral Land of Iron, to band together and trigger the Fourth Shinobi World War, as it was noted Madara's name itself was power. After his return from death and various enhancements, Madara was able to decisively defeat thousands of shinobi, the Five Kage, and the nine tailed beasts, all at one respectively.
